# ICON-MIGHTI Zero-wind phase determination software.
 Software that determines the zero-wind phase used in the processing of ICON MIGHTI wind data (Data Product 2.1) for version 05 (and possibly later versions, as well).

This is being distributed for the purposes of transparency and open science, as it is the primary factor in the accuracy of MIGHTI winds. Users should not expect this code to run as is without some modification. Anyone wishing to modify, test, or improve the code is encouraged to do so. Please reach out to Brian Harding (bharding@ssl.berkeley.edu) with any questions.

This software is a companion to, and provides a necessary input calibration for, the core Level 2 MIGHTI winds code: https://github.com/bharding512/airglowrsss/blob/master/Python/modules/MIGHTI_L2.py

A description of this algorithm can be found in the upcoming article:

Michelson Interferometer for Global High-resolution Thermospheric Imaging (MIGHTI) On-Orbit Wind Observations: Data Analysis and Instrument Performance. In preparation to be submitted to Space Sciences Reviews.
